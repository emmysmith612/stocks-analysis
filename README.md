# Analyzing Stocks with VBA 

## Overview of Project
For this project we were asked to utilize refactoring for a VBA code in Microsoft Excel to improve on collecting stock data for the years 2017 and 2018. The purpose of collecting this data was to determine which stocks were worth investing in.  

### Results 
The data that is reflected includes two charts which contains information on 12 stocks. In order to achieve the most accurate information on these 12 stocks we were asked to create a ticker to estimate the daily volume and the return on each.   

##  Advantages 
The main advantage of refactoring is improving on the organization of a code. With a cleaner code you have an improvement in software, programming, and the information becomes easier to read. In addition to that with refactoring most of the time you will see a significant decrease in macro run time. Overall, itâ€™s a great tool to use for maintenance and effectiveness of your code.

### Disadvantages  
One of the biggest disadvantages of refactoring however is the time constraint this can have on your project. On top of time, depending on the size of your application you are also increasing your chances of errors in your code. You could be putting your code at risk to not have the same functionality as it did before.
